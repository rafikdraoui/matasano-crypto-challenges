## Matasano Crypto Challenges

These are my (work in progress) solutions in Haskell to the Matasano Crypto
Challenges, available at [cryptopals.com](http://cryptopals.com)

My main goals are to (re)learn cryptography and to write my first non-trivial
Haskell programs. This means that my code will probably not be idiomatic, nor
follow the best practices and conventions of Haskell. I'm very open to feedback
regarding those!
